                <strong><i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i></strong> We decided to go for dry hire with Cottage
                Catering, and it was the best decision we
                made. The unit was fully equipped with everything we needed, and Ashley provided all the support and
                guidance we could have asked for. It allowed us the freedom to manage our event the way we wanted while
                ensuring everything was set up perfectly. Highly recommend for anyone looking to organize their own
                event with a professional edge! <br>– Laura & Tim <strong><i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i></strong>

                <strong><i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i></strong> Our private event was a success thanks to
                Cottage Catering. The food was amazing, and
                the staff was incredibly friendly and professional. We went with a buffet-style setup, and the gyros
                were a massive crowd-pleaser. Ashley and his team were so accommodating and ensured everything was
                perfect, which made our gathering stress-free and memorable.<br>– Claire & Greg <strong><i
