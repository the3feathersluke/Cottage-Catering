## Features to be Added
In the future i would look to add a search section that will search for keywords accros the site so that users can easily navigte to a section they were looking for for example if a user was soley looking for information on wedinngs

Another future development could be able to see a calendar of availability to ensure that the catering unit is avialable on a specific date.

Another future development would be for users to add a review onto the site.

![Issue 1](<assets/read-me-images/Issue 1.png>)
<br>

Issue #2: missing form lablel on the radio buttons on the contact form 
<br>
FIX : added a lable to the radio buttons of event type
<br>
![Issue 2](<assets/read-me-images/issue2.png>)
<br>

Issue #3: Redundant link in the nav bar of the home button
<br>
FIX : this was due to the cottage catering logo also directing to home page
